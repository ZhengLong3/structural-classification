# Structural Classification Project for CP4101

### Requirements

Code developed using Python 3.10 with the packages in `requirement.txt`.

### Files

- `gaussian_model.py`: provides the gaussian class with some functions
- `utils.py`: contains utility code for performing tasks such as k-means clustering and spectral clustering
- `tests.py`: contains code for generating test Gaussian models
- `structure_graph.py`: contains code for generating the structure graphs of rectangular planes
- `center_crop.py`: script to center crop a folder of images to the same size (largest possible size)
- `k-means_test.py`: random code for testing k-means implemented in `utils.py`
- `splat_test.py`: random code for testing spectral clustering on some Gaussian models
- `open3d_test.py`: random code for testing open3d planar patch detection on Gaussian models
